# Probabilistic Graphical Models

The project was done as a part of portfolio exam in Probabilistic Graphical Models course at Technical University of Kaiserslautern. The work is not published as stated in the report file, but aimed as a preparation for paper writing by considering all the requirements of the ICLR conference.

The aim of the project is to train  Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model and non-parametric topic model. The datased used for experiments is the original and modified 20NewsGroup.

The PGM__SS_2022Portfolio.pdf file reports perplexity and coherence scores for all the models, their differences in topics for the two dataset versions. Additionally, the analysis of the effect of number of topics and dataset size on the results is provided.
